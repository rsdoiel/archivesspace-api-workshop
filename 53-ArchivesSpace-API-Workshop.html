	<section><h1>5. Working with Agents</h1>

<h2>Our recipe</h2>

<p>Each ArchivesSpace API Model tends to have its own nuances based on the
schema. Agents is no exception. Rely on the docs as much as you can.
When the docs fail there is the email list and you can experiment too.
When I first started working with ArchivesSpace documentation was thin and I used <em>curl</em> and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/">jq</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look in the API Docs, what object module applies?

<ul>
<li>Is there more than one?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look at the HTTP method required (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE) for your action</li>
<li>Look at any data that needs to be sent, noting how it is sent

<ul>
<li>(e.g. a JSON blob or as part of a path)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the API docs, what responses do we expect?

<ul>
<li>(e.g. HTTP Status code, actual JSON body returned)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
