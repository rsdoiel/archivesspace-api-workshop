<h2>create_agent concerns</h2>

<p>If the API docs for models/schema are not available look at the
web UI for agents.  The required fields will in the form will be
the ones we want to handle. Sometimes you may have to experiment
and guess.</p>

<p>The API validates the requests. The response case from the API
will often hint at what we&rsquo;re missing.  <em>curl</em> can be a real help
here as the error response in JSON wil give us clues to what is
missing. Sometimes that is not as visible from the Python shell.</p>

<p>Relying on the API validation does allow us to simplify our client
code but we need to do more in our tests sorting out the right
structure to send.</p>
