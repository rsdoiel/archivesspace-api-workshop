Hello everyone,

I'd like to welcome everyone to our ArchivesSpace REST API workshop on Tuesday, Aug 2 at the ArchivesSpace Member Forum. 
Mark Custer and myself (Robert Doiel) will be leading the workshop. There are some things you hopefully have time to do before
the workshop Tuesday. They can be found at https://rsdoiel.github.io/archivesspace-api-workshop/requirements.html.  The presentation
(currently a draft) is visible at https://rsdoiel.github.io/archivesspace-api-workshop/00-ArchivesSpace-API-Workshop.html.

I believe we'll be provided with test instances for ArchivesSpace at the workshop but it doesn't hurt to have your own. I usually run
a copy under Vagrant on my Linux Laptop and Mac. You of course can install ArchivesSpace directly on your laptop/computer. Installation 
instructions can be found at 

    https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace 

and 

    http://archivesspace.github.io/archivesspace/user/getting-started/

You'll need Python 3.5.2 which can be downloaded and install from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Fee free to use your preferred text editor but Python comes with IDLE and I'll be using that to walk through the code we'll be writing.

Have a great weekend and look forward to meeting you Aug 2nd at the workshop.

All the best,

Robert Doiel
