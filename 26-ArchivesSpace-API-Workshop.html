<h2>Some words about encoding</h2>

<p>The web is organized around plain text and socket connections
between computers. We can not ship the data as it is in our computer&rsquo;s
memory to the other computer for lots of reasons. What we do
is translate it (encode it) in a predictable way.  A common way on
the web is &ldquo;urlencoding&rdquo;. Another type of encoding that has become
populate in recent years is JSON.  That&rsquo;s the encoding style we&rsquo;ll
use most often in our API requests but for authentication we use
&ldquo;urlencoding&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The final encode reference in our previous example was to &lsquo;utf-8&rsquo;. This
refers to a character encoding. They way we represent symbols
like letters or characters in other langauages like Danish, Hindi or
Korean. JSON by specification expects to be &lsquo;utf-8&rsquo;</p>

<p>So in one case we encode our data into an expected layout and in
another we explicitly encode it into a character representation.
Both are important.</p>
