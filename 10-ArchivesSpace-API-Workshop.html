<h2>About the code</h2>

<h3>The closing <em>if</em> block</h3>

<p>At the end of each of our Python scripts there will be an <em>if</em> block.
This is where our test code goes. For the purposes of the workshop we
will minimize what is inside this <em>if</em> block.  Normally you would
keep all your tests available (probably written as their own functions,
possibly as a separate included module).</p>
